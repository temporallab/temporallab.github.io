<h1>Temporally Informed Design Lab</h1>
<h3>Blog for CMU PhD Temporal Design Lab</h3>
<p>We are studying the inter-relationships between complex adaptive systems, identity, process and temporality, in order to find out what models can help designers distinguish between the challenges of pragmatic, functional, instrumentalist immediacy and the ethical, complex and multiplicative possibilities of pasts and futures, so that they can intend towards not only the immediate materialization that enables prototyping and validation of designs, but also into pasts and towards futures.</p>
<p>In order for Transition Design to enable sustainable, renewable change, Designers need to understand the imperatives of “looking up” from their immediate problem/solution framed tasks.</p>
